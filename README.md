# About

A wrapper (where possible) and fork (where necessary) of the Expo CLI and its tooling (e.g. Prebuild and Config Plugins, but perhaps also packages) to provide some level of support for **out-of-tree** platforms like [react-native-macos](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos) and [react-native-windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows).
